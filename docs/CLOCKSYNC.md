# Clock Synchronizer Help
# Port selection
  The clock uses serial communication for syncing the time from a computer to the clock. Ports on computers correspond to similar devices and they may change based on the USB Port they're connected on. The `COM1` Port is commonly listed as an available port but this is reserved for a physical port.

# Connecting and syncing
## Connecting
  Press the `connect` button after selecting the port that the clock is on.
## Syncing Time
  After you connect to the port, check the time on the PC and the time on the clock shown in the window. If you need to sync the time, click the `Sync` button.
## Finishing up
  Once the time is synced, you may close the window by pressing the `Done` button or pressing the `X`.
